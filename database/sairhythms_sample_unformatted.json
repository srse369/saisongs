There is no realization of the Supreme Consciousness without chanting the Lord's name.","language":"sanskrit / hindi","deity":"sai","raga":"khamaj","beat":"8 beat / keherwa / adi","tempo":"medium","level":"intermediate","audio_link":["https://sairhythms.org/sites/default/files/pages/songs/audio/hari-bhajana-bina-sukh-shanthi.mp3","https://sairhythms.org/sites/default/files/pages/songs/audio/hari-bhajana-bina-sukh-shanthi_1.mp3"],"video_link":[],"golden_voice":["https://sairhythms.org/sites/default/files/pages/songs/audio/hari-bhajana-bina-sukh-shanthi_2.mp3"],"songtags":"golden voice, multi-lingual, lead-music, sheet-music, tutorial","ulink":"tfDM","url":"/song/hari-bhajana-bina-sukh-shanthi"},{"song_id":"772","title":"Hari Bol Hari Bol Hari","title2":"Hari Bol Hari Bol Hari Hari Bol","lyrics":"Mukunda Madhava Govinda Bol\nHari Bol Hari Bol Hari Hari Bol\nKeshava Madhava Govinda Bol\n","meaning":"<p>Contemplate on the name and meditate on the Lotus Feet of Lord Hari.&nbsp;Worship the divine Flutist, Lord Madhava&nbsp;(Krishna).

my life be Your Message\nAs the Grace of God flows free\nLet everything that stands in The Way\nBe purified in me\nLet this life be a life that’s lived\nFrom the Center of Me that can only give\nA life that’s lived by You and not by me\nLet every thought that I think\nBe a promise to You that I’ll bring\nAn empty space for You to fill with Love\nWith Peace and Light as my sufficiency\nI turn to You ...You’re all I need\nTo Live a life not for me but for You\n \nI keep seemin’ to learn over and over\nThat bein’ the Doer makes the trip so much slower\nThat given’ it all up leaves room for

Shiva is beyond the scope of the words, has uncountable qualitative forms and manifestations, whose lotus-feet is revered by Brahma Vishnu and the demi-gods, and who has His consort on the left side of His own form Ardhanarisvara.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n3. Shiva is the Lord of the ghosts, has snakes as ornaments on various parts of the body, has a skin of the tiger as a cloth, has tress for locks, has three eyes, holds a trident and, provides respite from the fear of the rope and the whip (of Yama).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n4. Shiva has a diamond adorned by dewdrops on His forehead, has destroyed the five arrows of Kamadeva by emanating fire from His forehead, and has earrings are made by the king of snakes (Naga).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n5. Shiva has five faces, is like a lion for the intoxicated and proud persons, is like the destroyer of snake (mighty demons).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n6. Shiva is filled with resplendence, is both formed and formless, is unprecedented, is the source of all happiness, is undefeated and immeasurable, is surrounded by snakes, is indivisible (Brahma) and is matched only by Himself.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n7. Leaving behind desires, destroying the fretful complains about others and the indulgence in sins, restraining the mind in meditation, bringing Paresh (Shiva) to the middle of lotus-like mind, adore Him Who is the Lord of the city of Varanasi and Who is the Lord of the world.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n8. Shiva is beyond qualities, is the happiness of those belonging to Him, is the abode of dispassion and peace, is the companion of Girija, is enticing sweet and patient, and has consumed poison to protect creation.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n9. Devotees who study this popular eight-canto eulogy on Shiva the ruler of Varanasi attain liberation, knowledge, wealth, friends, and immeasurable glory.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n10.
